- Check Variable in nutshell -
```

Check Variable is a simple action to compare a variable, not limited only to text (string) and great for several functions, you can check the content of a message, check if a channel or user exists, there are several possibilities and ways to use this action, but as not everything is flowers, blind and intelligenceless beings exist, it's necessary to say that.

In case you didn't notice the Staff almost crucifying members in this bug channel. *The action is not broken*, there's nothing wrong, the __UPDATED__ version works __*PERFECTLY*__.
If you're having problems with this action, here is a short list of common mistakes you can make when using this action:

* 1 - You are using the old action with updated `bot.js` or the other way around.
* 2 - You are using the message object instead of its content (Await Response doesn't store the message content, but its object)
* 3 - You forgot the damn `'` at the beginning and/or at the end
* 4 - You used a variable in the wrong way, instead of `tempVars("Something")` you did `${tempVars(" Something")}`. (But there's especific cases where you need `${}`, be careful)
* 5 - You forgot something about the variable or made a typo, a `{` maybe, erased something, always check for missing stuff
* 6 - You used DBM first before using your brain and logical reasoning.

---------
If the action returned an error, __use the support channels__, don't look, think or imagine this channel, this channel is for **real bugs** and not for your mistakes or contraptions that go wrong.
If you've read this far, started using the action properly and just deleted the message you were writing about `Check Variable` not working, thanks a lot, but if you persist in asking for help on this channel because something went wrong with the fully functional action, don't complain when you get a warn or someone is rude to you.


Regards,

all users and staff bored with the same questions.
